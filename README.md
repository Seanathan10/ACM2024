## SlugCycle, our ACMHacks 2024 Project
SlugCycle is an app that allows UC Santa Cruz see where Bcycles are available and when the best times to get a BCycle. It does this by analyzing historic trends and identifying patterns to give the student the peak times and usage trends of each station. This allows students to accurately predict whether or not they can check out or return their Bcycle at a given station.

This project was built using React with Vite and MaterialUI, and utilized MapBox for the map.
